## Features

* In addition to `inner` drilldowns, new drilldown types were introduced: `relative`, `relativeNew`, `external`, `externalNew`. See `DrillDownType` interface for description.
* Hierarchy-based tables now support full datasource, e.g. all data for hierarchy is fetched in one request, as opposite to a previous hierarchies which fetched data one hierarchy level at a time. See `FullHierarchyTable` for implementation details.
* Table widget now supports `readOnly` flag from widget meta (#8).
* Support `defaultSort` property for business components (#4).
* Support `autoSaveBefore` flag for operations which indicates that before requesting widget operation API `required` fields of that widget should be validated for empty values (#1).

    * Pending changes should be considered for widget's showCondition calculation 
    * Hierarchy list bug fixes
 
## Misc

* Update contributing guide with corrections for `Branch organization` section
* .md files are now included in npm release

# Version 1.0.0

* Public release
* `[BREAKING CHANGE]` `id` field is removed from widget meta in favor of `name` field (as `id` is autogenerated after every update and unfit for widget-based business logic). All corresponding `widgetId` properties should be replaced with `widgetName` field.
* `View` and `DashboardLayout` no longer require `skipWidgetTypes` property, empty array is provided when missing for `DashboardLayout`.
